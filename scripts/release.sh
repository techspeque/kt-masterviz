# Prepare a release locally.
#
# All work is LOCAL and REVERSIBLE — this script never publishes to PyPI.
# Publishing is handled by .github/workflows/release.yml, which fires when
# the version tag is pushed to GitHub. This separation means:
#   - destructive ops (commit, tag) are reviewable on your machine
#   - PyPI uploads are auditable in CI logs and tied to the tag
#   - the tag is the single source of truth for what was released
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. Validate environment (clean tree, on main, tag doesn't exist)
#   2. Run full CI (prereqs + tests + coverage)
#   3. Bump __version__
#   4. Refresh uv.lock if present
#   5. Regenerate CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits
#   6. Commit the version bump + changelog
#   7. Create an annotated git tag (vX.Y.Z)
#   8. Build wheel + sdist into dist/ (sanity check; CI rebuilds and uploads)
#
# After the script finishes successfully, push the commit and tag to
# trigger the publish workflow:
#   git push origin main
#   git push origin vX.Y.Z
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/release.sh 0.2.0
#   bash scripts/release.sh 0.2.0-rc1
